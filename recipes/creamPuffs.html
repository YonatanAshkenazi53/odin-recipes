  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>Cream puffs, or profiteroles, are French choux pastry balls filled with cream.<br>
     Choux pastry is made without leavening agents — instead, it relies on a high moisture content to create steam and puff the pastry during baking.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix.</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream.</li>
        <li>1 cup milk.</li>
        <li>½ cup butter.</li>
        <li>1 cup water.</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>4 large eggs.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Directions:</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and refrigerate to set.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour and salt until the mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each.</li>
        <li>Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a couple of inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Centers should be dry.</li>
        <li>When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.</li>
     </ol>
